# Does-high-risk-really-mean-high-returns-
High risk does not imply higher returns as there is risk aversion phenomenon that start dominating on the risk return behavior of individuals. and that leads to downwards sloping of the risk return curve after reaching some threshold general risk appetite of individuals  

## Data Collected 
The data collected were of change in prices of NIFTY 50, volumes traded and total turnover fro 2006 to 2010 (which encloses the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-08)

## Relationships Observed
The relationship between returns and change in price(normalised) followed a linear trend, where I took change in price as the proxy of risk involved in the trade and analysed the slope of the positive normalised risk region to be smaller than the slope of the negative normalised region, which was approving the hypothesis that in the higher risk region, there should be lowering of extent of returns that one receives.
In the second trial, I took turnover and normalised change in prices, and tried to find a relationship of risk-return, but couldn't. ALthough the graph was symmetric about the turnover axis with positive sloped in the positive normalised price change region and negatively sloped in the negative normalised price change region but with couldn't conclude any concrete relationship and the reason why it happened.
